Rock Paper Scissors ReadMe

I used 'Teachable Machine', a machine learning tool, to create a model for the game 'Rock, Paper Scissors'. 'Teachable Machine' is a web-based tool that allows creation of machine learning models through a simple GUI (graphical user interface). In the tool I created 4 classes of response: 'Nothing', 'Rock', 'Paper' and 'Scissors. By using a webcam and positioning my hand, I captured 100 shots of each of the poses symbolising those 4 classes.

I will use this trained model to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, playable by 2 players with webcams.


I used Python3 to code a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. I split the program into 4 components: the announcement of the start of the battle, an input for the user to choose their weapon, an exciting countdown followed by resolution of the choices to decide the victor. I used an explicit series of 'if' statements to resolve the game. While not concise, this presents little ambiguity in the program's execution and provides legibility for future changes.
